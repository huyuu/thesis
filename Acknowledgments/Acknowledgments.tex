% Acknowledgments
I am grateful to Prefessor Makoto Tsuda for helpful discussions and comments on the slides,
along with Assistant Professor Yoh Nagasaki for his outstanding ideas.
Past and present members of our laboratory should not be missed for their participation in seminars and advises on Job hunting.
Masaki Maruyama, Daichi Wakamatsu, Yuuki Ichijou, Yu Yoshimura, Kannta Sawada and all the other members, thank you.

Beyond Tohoku University members,
I appreciate Mr. Ko Hsiao-Min, Yokohama National University for his thoughtful advises on the philosophy of life,
my girlfirend Megumi Baba for her dedicated support and exchanging experiences on difficult hierarchical relationship,
and my parents for their sincere support.

I personally express my sincere thanks to Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association for their scholarship.
It is their support that brings me the extraordinary life being a foreign researcher in Japan.

Finally, this work is sponser under the Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists project (No. JP19K15204) by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.
Without their funding support,
we would not have completed the most of our experiments and simulation.
